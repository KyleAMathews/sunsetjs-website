# SunsetJS Code of Conduct

We, the organizers of **SunsetJS**, are dedicated to
providing a harassment-free community for everyone, regardless of sex,
gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical
appearance, age, body size, race, nationality, or religious beliefs. We
do not tolerate harassment of community members in any form.
Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from
the community at the discretion of the organizers of **SunsetJS**.

Harassment includes offensive verbal or written comments related to sex,
gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical
appearance, age, body size, race, nationality, or religious beliefs,
deliberate intimidation, threats, stalking, following, harassing
photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events,
inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Sexual
language and imagery is not appropriate for any events at **SunsetJS**
meetups or in any related communication channels.
Community members asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to
comply immediately. Sponsors and presenters are also subject to the
anti-harassment policy.

If a community member engages in harassing behavior, the organizers of
**SunsetJS** may take any action they deem appropriate,
including warning the offender or expulsion from the community. If you
are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have
any concerns, please contact an organizer immediately.
